# MovieTrailerWebsite
Movie trailer website displays a list of movies where every movie has a popularity greater than 
25 on The Movie Database (TMdb). When a user clicks on a movie, its trailer plays in the center
of the website in a pop up. 

# Installation
First of all, create an account on TMdb and get an **API KEY**. Once you have the key clone the project 
using the SSH URL. Open the project in PyCharm or any IDE or run in terminal. Open the file called 
entertainment_center.py and paste the api key on line 20 where it says
api_key = "Put the movie database(TMdb) API KEY here." 
Now save the file and run entertainment_center.py from terminal using command - 
python entertainment_center.py. This will open website in the default webbrowser.
